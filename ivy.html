    <h1>Houseplant Interest Before & After Global Pandemic</h1>
    <h2>Based on Google Search Trends</h2>

    <h3>Common Ivy (Hedera helix)</h3>
    <h4>This beautiful trailing plant is another that is easy to find and very affordable making it an excellent place to start. They are a rewarding plant for their fast speed and their papery leaves that look too good to be true! Unfortunatley Ivy's delicate foliage are prone to pests which can lead to early demise.
        <br><br> Ivy have always been highly searched for, far more than the other four plants featured. The data however has a rather surprising trend, with the popularity being impacted most quickly of our selection, yet falling most rapidly as well. This could be caused by less of these plants being sold during the colder months, or perhaps people looking for other options to add to their collection.</h4>
