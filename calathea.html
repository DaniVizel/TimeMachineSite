    <h1>Houseplant Interest Before & After Global Pandemic</h1>
    <h2>Based on Google Search Trends</h2>

    <div class="right-text-wrap">
        <h3>Calathea (Marantaceae)</h3>
        <h4>Most often grown for their striking, bold patterns on their foliage, Calatheas are also known as prayer plants for their unique movement of leaves! Throughout the day and in the evenings, this plant will tuck its leaves upwards and in on itself, as if praying! Calatheas can be quite fickle when it comes to watering, humidity, and soil so they are not recommended for beginners. 
        <br> <br>Notice how even this plant, which was never as popular as some of the other more common houseplants, increased in searches a few months into the pandemic, showing that even existing plant enthusiants were looking to possibly grow their collection. </h4>
