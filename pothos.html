    <h1>Houseplant Interest Before & After Global Pandemic</h1>
    <h2>Based on Google Search Trends</h2>

    <h3>Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)</h3>
    <h4>This plant is very common and easy to pick up at many supermarkets in a wide assortment of variations, and for a good reason! Pothos grow very quickly and vine in long tendrils quickly creating the 'jungle vibe' that has become trendy on social media. They are also easy to propogate (the equivalent of plant duplication) and share with others inteterested in dipping their toes into the plant world.
        <br><br> This plant also saw quite a boom in popularity, even becoming the most searched for plant of our five. Despite always being popular, this clear spike in interest could be first time plant parents picking one up on a whim at the grocery store (one of the few essential places people were allowed to travel to) or perhaps existing owners spending more time at home and looking to learn more.</h4>
